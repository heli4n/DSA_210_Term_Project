# Correlation Between Democracy Level And Gender Representation in Media

## Dataset
Diplomatic News and Image Data - from [GlobalDiplomacyNet project](https://www.globaldiplomacy.net)
: Includes news articles about international diplomacy and their related photographs. Each entry contains details like country, year, and news context, along with the number of women and men shown in the images. This information helps calculate gender representation ratios. 

Democracy Data (V-Dem) -  from [V-Dem Full+Others v15](https://www.v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/country-year-v-dem-fullothers-v15/) 
: Includes country–year democracy indicators such as overall democracy score (v2x_polyarchy), egalitarian democracy (v2x_egaldem), female legislators (v2lgfemleg), gender quotas (v2lgqugen), female suffrage (v2fsuffrage), and presence of a female head of state or government (v2exfemhos / v2exfemhog).

## Motivation
Democracy is usually connected with fairness and equal participation in political and public life. Many studies look at institutions, for example, women in parliament or gender quotas. However, fewer studies explore how women are shown in international diplomacy media. Because images significantly influence public opinion, studying the frequency of women's representation in diplomatic news can help us understand the connection between democracy and gender representation. As a feminist, I chose this topic because I want to focus on the visibility of women in political spaces.

## Research Question
Is there a positive relationship between the level of democracy in a country and the visual representation of women in diplomacy-related media?
## Hyphothesis
H0: There is no relationship between democracy levels and the visual representation of women in diplomacy.
H1: Countries with higher levels of democracy tend to have a greater visual representation of women in diplomacy.
